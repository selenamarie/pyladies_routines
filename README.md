My teaching philosphy
=====================


Mission
=======
* Create an army of confident women developers

I believe
==========
* Anyone can learn
* Practice together is how we get there
* If someone didn't learn from our lesson, we didn't teach it properly

What I am making
================
* A learning community
* Women working together to learn Python

What I will do
==============
To create a safe space to explore, fail and learn, we:

* Work together
* Make mistakes
* Smash patriarchy

It's fun to not know things, and even more fun to learn.

What I won't do
===============
* Act surprised that a learner doesn't know something
* Start sentences with "Actually..."

How
===
* Practice what you teach
* Dare to fail
* Reward risk-taking
* Give positive feedback
